<h2 class="text-center">A New Role-Based Paradigm for specifying collaborating objects</h2>
<hr />
<p>The essence of object orientation is that networks of collaborating objects work
  together to achieve a common goal. The common sense of object oriented
  programming should reflect this essence with code that specifies how the objects collaborate.
  Our industry has, unfortunately, chosen differently and code is commonly written in terms of
  classes. A class tells us everything about the properties of the individual objects that are its
  instances. It does not tell us anything about how these instances work together to achieve the system
  behavior.</p>
<p>The result is that our code does not reveal everything about how a system will work. This is
  clearly not satisfactory, and we need a new paradigm as the foundation for more expressive
  code. The DCI (Data-Context-Interaction) is such a paradigm. DCI separates a
  program into different perspectives where each perspective focuses on certain system
  properties. Code in the <em>Data</em> perspective specifies how information is represented by stand-alone objects.
  Code in the <em>Context</em> perspective specifies runtime networks of interconnected objects as  similar structures of interconnected <em>roles</em>. Code
  in the <em>Interaction</em> perspective specifies how the networked objects collaborate to achieve the
system behavior. </p>
