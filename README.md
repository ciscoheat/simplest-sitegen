# simplest-sitegen

It's true, it really is the simplest static sitegen. Only HTML needed. No markdown, no yaml, no template languages, no huge documentation, and a one-step build process.

Documentation will soon follow, but if you're eager to try already, look at the [site](https://github.com/ciscoheat/simplest-sitegen/tree/master/site) directory how the input files are structured. Put them in a `src` directory, and run `simplest` in the directory above `src` to generate a `build` directory. Upload to a host, and you're done.
